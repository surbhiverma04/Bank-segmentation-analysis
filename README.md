# 🏦 Bank Segmentation Analysis (SQL Project)

This project simulates a real-world banking dataset and performs a series of SQL queries to extract valuable insights about customers, transactions, and geographic activity. It showcases my skills in SQL for data analysis, with a focus on financial data and customer segmentation.

---

## Project Objective

To analyze simulated banking data and uncover key insights that can help drive strategic decisions such as:
- Identifying high-value customers
- Understanding transaction behaviors
- Measuring regional banking performance
- Detecting dormant and underutilized accounts

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **PostgreSQL** (via pgAdmin)
- SQL (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)
- Data Simulation using PostgreSQL functions

## Project Structure

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Data Modeling & Simulation** | Created 3 core tables: `customers`, `accounts`, `transactions` using realistic Nigerian names, cities, account structures, and activity patterns. |
| **2. Data Querying** | Wrote 12 key SQL queries to extract insights and segment customer/account behavior. |
| **3. Reporting** | Documented insights with purpose-driven explanations for each query. |

## 📊 Key SQL Queries & Purposes

| No. | Query Title   | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Total Spend per Customer** | Calculate total amount spent per customer across all accounts. |
| 2 | **Salary Trend Analysis** | Identify salary credit trends across months. |
| 3 | **Most Active Accounts (Count)** | Find accounts with the highest number of transactions. |
| 4 | **Most Active Accounts (Volume)** | Rank accounts by total transaction volume. |
| 5 | **Monthly Transaction Breakdown** | View total transaction count and volume per month. |
| 6 | **Yearly Transaction Breakdown** | Track annual transaction growth or decline. |
| 7 | **Top 20 High-Value Customers** | Rank customers based on credit inflow (e.g., deposits, salary). |
| 8 | **Dormant Accounts** | Detect customers who’ve had no activity in the last 12 months. |
| 9 | **Single Product Customers** | Identify customers holding only one account. |
| 10 | **Most Used Transaction Services** | Discover the most frequent transaction descriptions (e.g., airtime, utility). |
| 11 | **City-wise Performance** | Measure total volume and number of customers per city. |
| 12 | **Engagement by Region** | Analyze activity vs dormancy spread across regions. |

## 🌟 Bonus Insight

> **Highest Spender by City**  
Uncovers the top spending customer in each city to help with targeted relationship management and regional performance boosts.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Built and queried a structured banking dataset from scratch.
- Strengthened core SQL concepts like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `FILTER`, `DATE_TRUNC`, and `CASE WHEN`.
- Gained deeper understanding of financial data behaviors — transaction types, account lifecycle, regional engagement.
